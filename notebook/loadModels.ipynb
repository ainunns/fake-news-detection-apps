The requirement, included in the annual Intelligence Authorization Act, mandates the Trump administration to submit a report to Congress outlining the intelligence to be shared with Russia, any counterintelligence risks, and plans to address those risks. The Senate Intelligence Committee approved the provision by a 14-1 vote in July as part of the broader bill overseeing operations by the CIA and other intelligence agencies.

Calling for unity in his victory speech, Trump urged Americans to “come together as one united people.” Clinton conceded the race in a phone call but postponed her public remarks. Despite his earlier rallying cries of “lock her up,” Trump acknowledged her public service contributions.Breaking through the Democrats’ strongholds, Trump flipped Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states that hadn’t backed a Republican presidential candidate since the 1980s. He also won key battlegrounds like Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina.

    "sample_text = 'Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s appearance before the Senate’s Commerce and Judiciary committees was a critical test for the future of social media platforms that skeptical lawmakers say need tougher regulations to prevent the proliferation of fake-news and interference in domestic matters by foreign adversaries. Lawmakers grilled the 33-year-old executive on the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm linked to the Trump campaign, harvested data from 87 million Facebook users to profile voters and sway the 2016 election. The hearing left many lawmakers unsatisfied and did not result in government oversight of social media platforms. But Zuckerberg said Facebook would be “investigating many apps, tens of thousands of app, and if we find suspicious activity, we’re going to conduct a full audit of those apps to understand how their using their data and if they’re doing anything improper..we’ll ban them from Facebook and we will tell everyone affected.”Zuckerberg admitted the company’s failure to stop Russian bots was one of his greatest regrets. He said Facebook tracked known Russian hacking groups in real time but that it took much longer to nail inflammatory posts by the IRA. Facebook later deployed artificial intelligence tools to detect malicious activity in elections in France, Italy, and a Senate race in Alabama. In closing, Zuckerberg said “There are people in Russia whose job is to exploit our systems. This is an arms race.” But the Cambridge Analytica debacle underscored how Facebook can be used for nefarious reasons, and how the tools social media platforms create can be exploited to manipulate users’ information. In May 2017, Facebook announced plans to hire 3,000 content reviewers.'\n",

His victory came after more than three days of uncertainty as election officials sorted through a surge of mail-in votes that delayed processing.Trump refused to concede, threatening further legal action on ballot counting. But Biden used his acceptance speech as an olive branch to those who did not vote for him, telling Trump voters that he understood their disappointment but adding, “Let’s give each other a chance.“It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, to lower the temperature, to see each other again, to listen to each other again, to make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy,” he said. “We are not enemies. We are Americans.”'\n",
